# SoundSnapper - AI-Powered Reality Remix

## Overview

SoundSnapper is a revolutionary camera application that transforms your everyday captures into immersive audio-visual experiences. Using the cutting-edge power of **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview (Nano Banana)** technology, the app analyzes scenes to generate synchronized soundscapes through **ElevenLabs' advanced audio generation APIs**.

The magic happens in real-time: snap a photo, let AI understand your scene, apply artistic transformations, and listen as your world comes alive with matching ambient sounds and effects. It's a complete sensory remix of reality powered by multimodal AI.

## Key Features

- **ü§ñ Intelligent Scene Analysis**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview analyzes camera captures to understand environmental context, lighting, objects, and spatial relationships
- **üé® Artistic Reality Transformation**: Fal AI integration provides sophisticated image transformations with styles like Cyberpunk, Anime, and Watercolor
- **üéµ Immersive Audio Generation**: ElevenLabs powers the complete audio experience through text-to-speech narration and AI sound generation
- **üì± Mobile-First Experience**: Optimized camera interface with touch interactions and responsive design
- **üé≠ Mood-Adaptive Processing**: Choose from Real, Dreamy, Sci-Fi, or Cartoon atmospheres for tailored audio-visual experiences
- **üîä Interactive Audio Controls**: Adjustable volume controls for ambient sounds and effects with real-time mixing

## How It Works

SoundSnapper orchestrates a seamless AI workflow that demonstrates the power of multimodal AI integration:

1. **üì∏ Capture**: Point your camera at any scene and tap "Snap!" to capture the moment
2. **üß† Analyze**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview performs deep scene analysis, understanding environmental context and generating structured JSON responses
3. **üé® Transform**: Choose from artistic styles powered by Fal AI's `gemini-25-flash-image/edit` endpoint for reality remixing
4. **üéµ Generate**: ElevenLabs creates matching audio experiences with ambient soundscapes and contextual sound effects
5. **‚ú® Experience**: Enjoy your transformed reality with synchronized audio-visual content

The innovation lies in the seamless coordination between vision AI, image transformation, and audio generation - creating a complete sensory journey from a single camera capture.

## ElevenLabs Integration

SoundSnapper leverages multiple ElevenLabs APIs to create rich audio experiences:

### **Text-to-Speech Narration**
```typescript
const playTextToSpeech = async (text: string, voiceId = 'Xb7hH8MSUJpSbSDYk0k2') => {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/${voiceId}`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 
            'Accept': 'audio/mpeg', 
            'Content-Type': 'application/json', 
            'xi-api-key': ELEVENLABS_API_KEY 
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            text: text, 
            model_id: 'eleven_monolingual_v1',
            voice_settings: { stability: 0.5, similarity_boost: 0.5 }
        })
    });
    
    const audioBlob = await response.blob();
    const audio = new Audio(URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob));
    audio.play();
};
```

### **AI Sound Generation**
```typescript
const generateAndPlayAudio = async (text: string, type: 'ambience' | 'sfx') => {
    const payload = {
        text: text, 
        model_id: "eleven_text_to_sound_v2",
        ...(type === 'ambience' && { loop: true, duration_seconds: 10 })
    };

    const response = await fetch(`https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/sound-generation`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 
            'Accept': 'audio/mpeg', 
            'Content-Type': 'application/json', 
            'xi-api-key': ELEVENLABS_API_KEY 
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    });
    
    const audioBlob = await response.blob();
    const audio = new Audio(URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob));
    audio.loop = type === 'ambience';
    audio.play();
};
```
